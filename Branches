What is a branch?
I have Repo called Learn-git.
with each commit a change happened, a linear list.
If I want to experiment and maybe not keep it, I need a branch.
A git hub repo the main linear list of commits is on the 'Master Branch'
You can have lots of different branches.
I want to branch off and create a branch called 'Unicorn' for experimentation.
Top LHS of screen is a brach-like symbol with 'Main' next to it.
My files so far are on this master branch.
I don't have any other branches so far.
Click on 'Main' and a box with 'Find or create a branch' will appear.
In this box type 'Unicorn'.
You are then given an option to 'Create branch: Unicorn' fro the main branch because this branch does not exist.
If it did exist it would give me the option to switch to this branch.
Click on create branch.
The Unicorn branch is now created.
Go to the Unicorn branch.

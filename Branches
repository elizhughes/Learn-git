What is a branch?
I have Repo called Learn-git.
with each commit a change happened, a linear list.
If I want to experiment and maybe not keep it, I need a branch.
A git hub repo the main linear list of commits is on the 'Master Branch'
You can have lots of different branches.
I want to branch off and create a branch called 'Unicorn' for experimentation.
Top LHS of screen is a brach-like symbol with 'Master' next to it.
My files so far are on this master branch.
I don't have any other branches so far.

So, now I'm going to start to edit this branch by adding a unicorn.
Scroll down to the commit button.
Note: It says comit directly to the unicorn branch.
Alo note:  Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request. This allows you to create a new branch for the commit.
Just now commit to Unicorn branch.

Branching is making a more substantive commitment to your changes and putting them in a new path.
Allows you to have 2 possibilities going on at the same time.
However, what if you want to bring the unicorn branch back into the master branch.
Go into Graphs and then network to see the branching of your repo.

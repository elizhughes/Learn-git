What is a branch?
I have Repo called Learn-git.
with each commit a change happened, a linear list.
If I want to experiment and maybe not keep it, I need a branch.
A git hub repo the main linear list of commits is on the 'Master Branch'
You can have lots of different branches.
I want to branch off and create a branch called 'Unicorn' for experimentation.

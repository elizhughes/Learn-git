Forks and pull requests
When you Fork another repo youar essentially making a complete copy of this repo and having it in your account.
This will be an exact replica that you can then work on.
A Pull request is when you wish to contribute back to the priginal repo some of the work you have done in your copy.
i.e. you are asking with a pull request since the info is going to a different account that you do not have permissions to alter.
